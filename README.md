## Theme
Disposing of waste has huge environmental impacts and can cause serious problems. Needless to say, the most important reason for proper waste management is to protect the environment and for the health and safety of the population. It is a very important topic that needs to be addressed, and everyone should be aware why waste segregation can be the difference between the survival of the earth and the worsening effects in the natural biological system.

Often people dispose waste without the knowledge of proper waste management. There is a need for an analysis on the current waste management scenario and the effects of ineffective waste management.

 
## Our Solution
We provide an easy solution to a big problem of waste management through deep learning which classifies products into three types : Plastic, Recyclable and Organic. Along with this, we are giving a brief overview about different types of pollution. Now, the main feature of our website is a ecommerce site for waste items that might be recyclable and reusable. It facilitates easy, quick and safe payment system based on Ethereum network of blockchain.
